## Introduction

Using Node Js it was implemented a undirected Path visualization solution to that takes in an array of edges for an undirected graph and two nodes (nodeA, nodeB). The function should return a boolean indicating whether or not there exists a path between nodeA and nodeB.

## Graph Vizualization

First, you see the graph structure, then you can see each visited node according to the chosen points, so each node visited should be highlighted with yellow color.

## Live
